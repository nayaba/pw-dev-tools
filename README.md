Hey there, future developers! Let's get you familiar with some essential tools you'll be using day in and day out as you embark on your journey into coding.

### Developer Tools Overview

Think of these tools as the trusty sidekicks that will help you build and manage your projects efficiently.

#### The Terminal: Your Command Center

- **What It Is**: The Terminal is a text-based interface to operate your computer. You'll use it to navigate through files, run scripts, and interact with your system more directly.
- **Why It Matters**: It's a powerful way to perform tasks quickly and a fundamental skill for any developer to navigate and manage the backend of their projects.

#### Visual Studio Code (VSCode): Your Code Workshop

- **What It Is**: VSCode is a popular code editor where you'll spend a lot of time writing and editing your code. It's user-friendly and supports a multitude of programming languages.
- **Why It Matters**: With its integrated support for debugging, task running, and version control, VSCode provides an efficient platform for day-to-day coding tasks.

#### Git & GitHub: Your Collaboration and Version Control Toolkit

- **What It Is**: Git is a version control system that lets you track changes and collaborate on code. GitHub is an online platform where you can store your Git repositories and collaborate with others.
- **Why It Matters**: These tools are crucial for managing code changes, especially when working on team projects. They allow you to revert to previous versions if needed and work on different features simultaneously.

### Pre-Class Prep

Here's a simple guide to help you dip your toes into these tools before we start the class:

- **Intro to the Terminal**: We have a concise video that will give you a quickstart on using the Terminal. For Windows users, you'll need to install WSL and Ubuntu to get a Unix-like environment where you can run commands.

  - **Pro Tip**: Choose the same username and password for your UNIX setup as your computer login to keep things simple.

- **Intro to VSCode**: Download and install VSCode, and watch a video that introduces you to its interface and features. It's going to be your home base for coding, so getting comfortable with it is key.

- **Intro to Git & GitHub**: There's a video to walk you through the basics of these two platforms. Note that even though the video might suggest installing a different text editor, we'll be using VSCode throughout our course.

### Getting Ready

While you're encouraged to explore these videos to get acquainted with the tools, remember that we'll be going over everything in more detail in our first class. So if you hit a snag or something doesn't quite click, don't worry. We'll cover all of this and make sure everyone is on the same page once the class officially starts.

Enjoy your exploration, and see you on day one for a comprehensive walkthrough!
