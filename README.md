Hey future code conjurers! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª Let's take a whirlwind tour of the wizardry tools of web development. We're talking about the mystical Terminal, the spellbinding ways of version control, and the enchanting world of Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub.

### Getting Acquainted with Developer Tools

Think of these tools as your digital wand, spellbook, and crystal ball. They're your everyday companions on the path to becoming a coding sorcerer.

#### The Terminal: Your Magic Portal

- **What It Is**: The Terminal is like the secret passage to the heart of your computer. It's where you can type commands to tell your computer exactly what to do, without any mouse clicks.
- **Why It Matters**: Every wizard needs to know how to whisper to their familiar, and for developers, the Terminal is just that. It's crucial for navigating files, running programs, and casting code spells more efficiently.

#### Visual Studio Code (VSCode): Your Enchanted Editor

- **What It Is**: VSCode is where you'll write your incantations (code). It's powerful, customizable, and has a ton of extensions to make your coding life magical.
- **Why It Matters**: Just like a wand needs to feel right in your hand, VSCode can be tailored to fit your coding style perfectly. It's where your ideas turn into reality.

#### Git & GitHub: Your Spell-Tracking Scroll

- **What It Is**: Git is like your spell revision history, tracking changes in your code. GitHub is where you publish your grimoire (code) for other wizards to see and collaborate on.
- **Why It Matters**: Imagine casting a spell that goes haywire. Git lets you roll back to when it was last perfect. And GitHub? It's the grand library of Alexandria for code.

### Your Quest Before Class

Don't fret if these tools seem like ancient, arcane artifacts right now. Here's a sneak peek to demystify them:

- **Intro to the Terminal**: Check out a quick video to get the lay of the land. Windows users, you've got a side quest: Install WSL and Ubuntu for a seamless Terminal experience.
  - **Remember**: When setting up UNIX credentials, stick to your computer login details. Once you've got Ubuntu, it‚Äôs your new coding lair.

- **Intro to VSCode**: Grab this editor from the digital ether (download it), and watch a video that'll tour you around its hidden chambers and secret compartments.

- **Intro to Git & GitHub**: Watch the storytelling unfold in a video about these tools. Even though it mentions Atom, we‚Äôre going to stick with VSCode.

### The Spell of Preparation

These prep videos are like the early chapters of your adventure‚Äîthere to give you a taste of the magic. If it seems like you're trying to read runes, relax. It‚Äôs just about getting a feel for things. We‚Äôll dive deep into these tools when class begins, and you'll have plenty of time to practice your spells.

So, kick back, watch some videos, and let your curiosity lead the way. See you in class for the real magic! üéì‚ú®
