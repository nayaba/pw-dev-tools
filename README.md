Hey there, future developers! Let's get you familiar with some essential tools you'll be using day in and day out as you embark on your journey into coding.

### Developer Tools Overview

Think of these tools as the trusty sidekicks that will help you build and manage your projects efficiently.

#### The Terminal: Your Command Center

- **What It Is**: The Terminal is a text-based interface to operate your computer. You'll use it to navigate through files, run scripts, and interact with your system more directly.
- **Why It Matters**: It's a powerful way to perform tasks quickly and a fundamental skill for any developer to navigate and manage the backend of their projects.
- **Intro to the Terminal**: We have a [concise video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ7Kix9bjPI) that will give both Mac and Windows users an overview of what the Terminal is.
- **Practice Lessons**: Here are few introductory Terminal lessons to get you familiar with using executing commands.

  - [Command Structure](https://youtu.be/W3vQxd1vTSE?si=oGuBS1T9plOAsx5v)
  - [Directory Basics](https://youtu.be/W3vQxd1vTSE?si=oGuBS1T9plOAsx5v)

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è For Windows users, there's a bit of setup to get your Terminal ready to go with a Unix-like environment if you want to follow along with the above Terminal Lessons. You'll follow the [WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Installation Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KVdJ43dQmE), but just watch up to the 8:24 mark for now.
  
  - Here are a few key points to note during your installation:
    - Use the same username and password for UNIX as your Windows login during the WSL2 installation.
    - After installing WSL2 and Ubuntu, you'll use Ubuntu's Terminal, not PowerShell, for coding tasks.

**Don't worry if these steps seem complex - you don't _have_ to install anything today; we'll go through the steps together in class to ensure everyone is set up and ready to code!**

#### Visual Studio Code (VSCode): Your Code Workshop

- **What It Is**: VSCode is a popular code editor where you'll spend a lot of time writing and editing your code. It's user-friendly and supports a multitude of programming languages.
- **Why It Matters**: With its integrated support for debugging, task running, and version control, VSCode provides an efficient platform for day-to-day coding tasks.

#### Git & GitHub: Your Collaboration and Version Control Toolkit

- **What It Is**: Git is a version control system that lets you track changes and collaborate on code. GitHub is an online platform where you can store your Git repositories and collaborate with others.
- **Why It Matters**: These tools are crucial for managing code changes, especially when working on team projects. They allow you to revert to previous versions if needed and work on different features simultaneously.
- You should have created a github.com account during pre-work, but if for some reason you still don't have an account, go ahead and [create one now](https://github.com/signup).

### Getting Ready

üìå **While you're encouraged to explore these videos to get acquainted with the tools, remember that we'll be going over everything in more detail in our first class. So if you hit a snag or something doesn't quite click, don't worry. We'll cover all of this and make sure everyone is on the same page once the class officially starts.**

Enjoy your exploration, and see you on day one for a comprehensive walkthrough!
